# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This is the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera. Code is written in R in file. This R script does the following things:
1. Download the data
2. Load the data
3. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
4. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
5. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
6. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
7. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

The data for the project:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

R script Source file is `run_analysis.R`. 
Final output is `tidy_data_set.txt`.
`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any work that perform to clean up the data.
